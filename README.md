# FFI bindings for macOS Core Services framework

These bindings are currently woefully incomplete, and contain only a handful of Launch Services functions I've needed.

However, this crate is the right place to add more of `CoreServices.framework` functionality, so please [make pull requests](https://github.com/kornelski/core-services) adding whatever functionality you need.
